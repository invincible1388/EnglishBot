     { definition: 'From the old [French] word for [knighthood], "chevalerie", the art of being a [chevalier] (a [knight] or horseman).\r\nThis was originally a system by which mounted warriors were to act, but while service to their people is touched upon the general goal of [medieval] knights was not saving many a [damsel in distress], devotion to God, or enforcing justice; most knights defined chivalry as [warfare] and obtaining [fame] and [fortune] in the name of their king(s) and without any display of cowardice in battle. In a sense, it\'s hardly different from joining the military for the benefits that it offers, including the money that pours in from the business of [war]. Chivalry was basically a boy\'s culture: fighting other men, riding horses, power and profit and the ability to exploit that power.\r\nThe modern notion of chivalry as [courtesy] to women has [tenuous] links to chivalry as it was originally conceived. Perhaps [courtly love] (coined in 1883 to describe the worship of a married noblewoman by a lowly [troubadour] or knight and his vow to do great deeds in her honor) influenced this notion, but courtly love is, for all intents and purposes, [adultery] (very dangerous to both participants) and to what extent that courtly love was ever practiced remains unknown.',

       example: 'Chivalry, for the most part, was the opposite of the [Geneva Convention]; it was all about making a profit on war. The image of an [honorable] knight saving a fair maiden from a dragon is not much more than sheer fantasy, and most of it seems to stem from the [Victorian] era; the Victorians, in the midst of the [Industrial Revolution], looked at the [Middle Ages] through [rose colored glasses] as an idyllic place of pre-industrial innocence, projecting their own ideals of men and women onto the knight and the [damsel in distress]. A real [knight in shining armor] was actually more like a trained [assassin] and the local [rapist] rolled into one and the damsel in distress, a helpless [shrinking violet], never really existed.',
